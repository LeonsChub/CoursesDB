# CoursesDB Project

This is a project I made using Express and MySql in the backed, in order to keep track of course leads. and React and css in the front-end in order to display the information in a palatable way. each student must create an account and then sign up to the courses he wishes to enlist in. their entry is recorded in the database and updated on the front end immediately 

in order to run the app you must.
Step 1: clone the repository.

step 2: run "npm install" in both back-end and front-end to download the necessary dependencies.

step 3: run "npm run start" in both folders to run the front end application and the backed.

* this assumes you have mysql already installed and a DB server running on your PC.
